Important:
I decided to use Vite instead of CRA, So the command should be "npm run dev" instead of "npm start"

Notes:
I chose to not use redux as the app was fairly simple and did not contain any prop drilling. This project took me about 4 hours to complete in total.
I mimicked an API and simulated loading times.
MaterialUI was used for styling, I did not add a theme because the default colors look well enough.

If i had more time i would probably styles some things a bit better and maybe add pagination for convenience.
